Potential sources of incompatibilities between Coq V8.2 and V8.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

(see also file CHANGES)

Most sources of incompatibilities can be avoided by calling coqtop or
coqc with option "-compat 8.2". The sources of incompatibilities
listed below must however be treated manually.

Syntax

- The word "by" is now a keyword and can no longer be used as an identifier.
  [Semantics, IEEE754]

Type inference

- Many changes in using classes. [ATBR]

Library

- New identifiers of the library can hide identifiers. This can be
  solved by changing the order of Require or by qualifying the
  identifier with the name of its module.  [Stalmarck]

- Reorganisation of library (esp. FSets, Sorting, Numbers) may have
  moved or removed names around. [FundamentalArithmetics, CoLoR,
  Icharate, AMM11262, FSets, FingerTree]

- Infix notation "++" has now to be set at level 60. [LinAlg]

Tactics

- The synchronization of introduction names and quantified hypotheses
  names may exceptionally lead to different names in "induction"
  (usually a name with lower index is required). [Automata]

- More checks in some commands (e.g. in Hint) may lead to forbid some
  meaningless part of them. [CoLoR]

- When rewriting using setoid equality, the default equality found
  might be different. [CoRN]
